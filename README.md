## Notes

This project had significantly more independent elements than the last one. It turned out to be a good challenge getting elements aligned exactly how I wanted them to be aligned. It required use of flexboxes and other display models, some of which I had never used before.

It was also another challenge to get the app to work on conditionality. For example, applying CSS based on whether the flipcard is facing front or back.
